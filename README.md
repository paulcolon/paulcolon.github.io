<h1>Mandolin Man</h1>
<p>This is a website for music fans of the mandolin. 
Its purpose is to provide information on learning mandolin.
As well as locations for local music jams and regional festivals.
I tried to give the site easy  navigation with a robust code  stability.
This site was built to fulfill Code Louisville Front-end Development class project.
